## Disclaimer

```
As of now compiling has only been tested on MACOS. 
```

## Setup

It is recommended to use `CLION` as the IDE for this project as it makes working with `CMAKE` a lot easier.
It is not guaranteed that any of the other IDEs will work seamlessly with this project.

### Libs

The project uses the following libraries:

- systemc v.2.3.3

Systemc is already installed in ./lib/systemc. No further action has to be taken.

## Build and Execute

To build the project, run the following commands:

```bash
./build.sh
```

The binary will be created in the `./bin` directory. Execute it using

```bash
./bin/main
```

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
This might be subject to change though!

```

- `bin`: This directory contains the executable file main generated by the build process.
- `build.sh`: This is a shell script used to build the project.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: This file is used by CMake to control the build process.
- `lib`: This directory contains the SystemC library.
- `src`: This directory contains the source code of the project
    - `csv_parser.c`: This file contains the implementation of the CSV parser.
    - `help.c`: This file contains the implementation of the help command.
